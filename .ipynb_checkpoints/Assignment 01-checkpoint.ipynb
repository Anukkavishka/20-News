      "The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\n",
      "The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\n",
      "(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\n",
      "coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\n",
      "(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\n",
      "algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\n",
      "difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\n",
      "algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\n",
      "use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\n",
      "dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\n",
      "the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\n",
      "\n",
      "Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\n",
      "+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\n",
      "over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\n",
      "is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\n",
      "expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\n",
      "somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\n",
      "by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\n",
      "constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\n",
      "lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\n",
